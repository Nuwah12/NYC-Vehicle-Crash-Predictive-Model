# NYC Crash Predictor
Term project for CIS5450. Big Data Analytics, at the University of Pennsylvania (Master of Science in Engineering in Data Science Program, MSE-DS).
We aimed to buiild a classification model that could predict where a car crash would happen (i.e. in ehat NYC borough), as well as a model that could predict how severe a crash would be (0/no medical attention required, 1/medical attention required), using a number of features from multiple integrated datasets.
